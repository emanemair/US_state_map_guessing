# US_state_map_guessing

## Instructions
Upon running the script, a window will pop up displaying a blank US map.

The program will prompt you to guess the names of US states. Enter the names of states one by one, following the prompt.

The program will use Turtle graphics to display the guessed state names on the map.

The game continues until you correctly guess 50 state names or choose to exit by entering "Exit".
